<h2>Human - Machine Interaction Project</h2>

<p>In a team of 2, we implemented in 3 steps the website for the book distribution of greek universitites.
<br><b>1st Step: </b> Found what is wrong with the existing website using the Nielsen's usability heuristics
<br><b>2nd Step: </b> Designed in wireframes the website
<br><b>3rd Step: </b> Implemented the website<br>
